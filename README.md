This repo contains example codes used on Computer Networks part 2 laboratories
conducted on Poznan University of Technology.

## How to compile
All examples you can compile manually (automation is on my To Do list). Just invoke:
```
gcc -Wall -Wextra -o program_filename prog.c
```
in a folder where your program is placed. `prog.c` should be replaced by a
source file you want to compile. `program_filename` you can replace by any
name you want, it will be the name which a result program will receve.
